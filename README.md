<b> STUDIO GHIBLI MOVIES :sparkles:</b>

Hello! This is a simple landing page project using only HTML, CSS and Boostrap4. 
<hr>
I'm trying to improve my frontend skills and learn how to develop pretty and inclusive pages, also I choose Studio Ghibli as theme because they have a lot of cute images.

I know its kinda simple, but I will improve this project using all stuff that I learned in this one-archive exercise in my future rails applications. :gem:
